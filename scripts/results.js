"description": "Looking for a Custom Illustration? Contact me to create a custom design for you. \n\nCustom Illustrations cost $100 and include an 8 by 10 print, on high quality 100lb. cover 100% recycled paper. Looking for other options for printing such as a larger scale or printed on other materials including canvas? No problem! Convo me with specifics and I can let you know your options and if there is an additional cost.\n\nSpecial note: Custom illustrations are created specifically and uniquely for you and will never be re-used, reproduced, or sold to another person/customer. Custom illustrations involve a significant amount of time, care, and thought to create and are one-of-a-kind. I always remain in close contact with you and will work with you to make sure that each custom illustration is completed to your complete satisfaction and fits your needs as well as is a reflection of you, or the chosen recipient&#39;s, personality. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this listing is not for illustrations intended to be used on websites, blogs, reproduced prints, or promotional material of any kind. Please visit the listing for &quot;Custom illustrated blog header&quot; or &quot;Custom Corporate Illustration&quot; for  illustrations of that nature (See links below.)\n\nBlog Header: https://www.etsy.com/listing/93755173/custom-illustrated-blog-header-design?ref=shop_home_active_17\n\nCorporate Illustration: https://www.etsy.com/listing/187484555/custom-corporate-illustration-shop?ref=shop_home_active_16\n\nA few REVIEWS from customers who I have worked with on custom illustrations: \n\n&quot;Michelle is a sum of creativity and fabulousness! After requesting a custom illustration at the &quot;last minute&quot; as a gift for my husband&#39;s birthday- Michelle read the story and immediately brought the character to life! She was very easy to work with and produced quality work within a short time frame. He was beyond pleased with the illustration and can&#39;t wait to hang it in his law office. I will be using Michelle again and have recommended her to several relatives and friends!&quot;\n\n&quot;AMAZING Work!!! Such a creative item and so much hard work put into these customized products. My friends and family love them!&quot;\n\n&quot;This is the second time I have worked with Michelle on a custom illustration order! She has a great artist eye and can really capture personalities in her pieces (both pets and people). I love her work and can&#39;t wait to work with her on something again, in the future! Thank you, Michelle!&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent! Great to work with! I&#39;ll definitely be back again. Thanks for the great service. We love our design!!!!&quot;\n\n&quot;Michelle, you&#39;ve done it again! Thank you for your awesome work and creativity! My boyfriend will absolutely love this gift. As always, I will continue referring you to everyone I know!&quot;\n\n&quot;I am *in love* with the tote Michelle made for me. The sketch looks exactly like my little puglet; it&#39;s amazing really. Michelle was amazing to work with and couldn&#39;t be sweeter. I will be recommending this talented gal to everyone I know! I even wrote a blog post about the whole experience: http://salvagedstrawberry.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/sweet-musings.&quot;",

I have a BFA in illustration from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Color theory, gestural lines, and whimsical imagery, are all part of my illustrations as well as a sense of fashion (especially if it involves Paris, sailor stripes, and a bit of fun!)\r\n \r\nIn 2011 I left my full-time job in order to pursue my dream of becoming an illustrator. Since then I have worked with incredible clients on amazing projects, and could not feel happier. Every day is unique and every day involves illustrating. \r\n\r\nI pride myself on customer service, high quality products, and attention to detail. I want to make sure each client and shopper is 100% happy with each order. A single illustration can take hours, even simple ones. I like to explore personality and style in each and every illustration. This is especially important in custom orders where I know my clients are looking for something special/something all their own. \r\n\r\nFor questions or comments please email me at Michelle@MichelleBaron.com.",

Each individual listing that is ordered comes with 1 clasp needle. \n\n:: Important Note ::\nI am working hard on providing directions for those who need it.

You have the option of setting it up however you&#39;d like, and also printing double sided if you choose. If you purchase another size other than A5/Half Letter, you&#39;ll note cut lines (crop marks) on your printout. This is meant to be a guide for you to know where to cut so the page sits appropriately in your planner. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend printing on at least 28 lb paper to get a nice, stable page, but you can of course print on any paper you choose.

Therefore, if the sample is in all lowercase, the name on the planner will read &quot;sarah jean&quot;. If the sample shows all capital letters, the name on the planner would read &quot;SARAH JEAN&quot;.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS:\n\n- This is a 12 Month Monthly Notebook\n- Monthly Tab, Monthly Spread, 6 Notes Pages (12 front and back) per month\n- Planner can begin in ANY month you choose\n- Planner Size: 7.5&quot; x 9&quot;\n- 12 Monthly LAMINATED TABS\n- Clear Frost Plastic Cover\n- Personalized Name on Cover\n- Month and Year-at-a-glance pages\n- 6 Notes Pages Per Month (12 front and back)\n- Contacts Page\n- Passwords Page\n- Special Dates 2-Page Spread\n- Holidays\n- 2 Sided Pocket Folder\n- The year on the cover will reflect the year/years of the planner ordered.\n(example: A planner from August 2014 - July 2015 will have &quot;2014-2015&quot; on the cover)\n\n\nChanges CANNOT be made to the inside planner page layouts and design.\n\n\nWe have many different varieties of planners, so please make sure you are ordering the correct version for yourself (Regular Planner, Wedding Planner, Meal Planner, Fitness Planner, Teacher Planner, or Student Planner).\n\n\n*Print Color: We do our best to match the colors of the covers shown on the computer screen.

For Hawaii & Alaska shipments, transit time is 8-15 BUSINESS days.\r\n\r\nUS Priority Shipping: 3 Business Days - Available at time of checkout \r\n\r\nStandard shipping is through UPS Mail Innovations.

While this does take a little longer in transit, we also offer express shipping for an additional fee. \r\n\r\nFor Standard Shipping, transit time is approximately 3-8 business days depending on where you are located in the United States. We ship from CA, so east coast shipments will take the longest. This does NOT include Weekends or Holidays. For Hawaii & Alaska shipments, transit time is 8-15 BUSINESS days.\r\n\r\nThe Estimated Delivery date on your tracking is an estimate, not a guaranteed date. Please be patient with the tracking as it can be slow to update online sometimes. \r\n\r\nPriority shipping is 3 business days to anywhere in the US.

Additional charges are the responsibility of the recipient because we have no control over these government-imposed charges and cannot determine what they may be. Customs policies vary greatly among countries. Please contact your local customs office for information.\r\n\r\nTo avoid a delay in receiving your order from customs, consider the following:\r\n\r\n- Please do not refuse a shipment or ignore requests from carriers regarding duty and/or tax liability charges. Be aware that most carriers will hold a shipment for 5 days after arrival in your country before they return it to the sender.\r\n\r\n- We do not refund original shipping charges for goods that are refused for delivery at customs.\r\n",

This includes color changes, font changes (substitute any font that we already offer on any of our planner designs), adding a second line of text, removing the year, and adding a photo or monogram. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to see a preview of what your cover will look like before we print it, you can purchase a design proof to make sure it is just the way you like it.\r\n\r\nMany of the inside layouts can be customized as well.
