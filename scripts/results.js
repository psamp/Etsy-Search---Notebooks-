When we sit down after meditation and take a few minutes to journal what we\u2019ve been experiencing, it makes it pretty obvious how effective we\u2019ve really been. If we examine our experience, honestly and with a desire to learn, then we become much more aware of what our meditation practice actually is. We can become more aware of our weaknesses and our strengths, and have a much more penetrating understanding of what we need to be working on.\n\nA journal also allows us to look back at our experience as it has changed over a period of time. We can review several days, weeks, or months of our practice and learn about the patterns that our consciousness follows. Perhaps we\u2019ll discover that we are lazier than we thought, or perhaps that we try too hard, or perhaps even that we fluctuate in our efforts. We may discover that there are particular distractions that are much more common that we had recalled. We commonly also discover \u2013 especially when we\u2019re feeling a little down \u2013 that our meditation practice has been more effective and enjoyable than we had remembered.\n\nAnd our journaling can help us to set goals. It\u2019s not that we try to pin down our experience before it happens \u2013 that\u2019s rarely if ever going to work and it\u2019s more likely to result in frustration than in any progress in our meditation practice. Instead what we\u2019re trying to do in setting goals is to develop a stronger sense of where we want to go in our meditation practice. Through looking back at our past experience we can see what we need to work on. Perhaps it\u2019s forgiveness or patience that we need to develop. Perhaps it\u2019s more persistence. Or more calmness. Whatever changes we want to make, having clear goals will help us attain them. Our goals become the magnetic north pole that allows us to navigate through our experience in order to get where we want to go.\n\n\n*** please read shipping\/policy prior to purchase ***\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* Please understand this is hand stamped and will not look like a machine produced journal.

For the cover, you can choose a favorite quote, song lyrics, a Bible verse, etc. I will also personalize the inside of the front cover. The cover is hand lettered in archival quality ink on a lined Moleskine notebook, so it is durable enough to use every day. When you purchase the notebook, please leave whatever quote you would like along with the name you would like inside the front cover in the \u201cmessage to seller\u201d box at checkout. If you have any lettering style preferences or illustration preferences, you can mention those as well.\n\nI chose to use Moleskine journals because they are high quality and are a trusted brand among artists and writers. They are perfect for day-to-day use with a heavy duty cardboard cover and visible stitching on the spine that matches the cover color. Each journal is 5\u201dx8\u201d with 80 lined pages with a pocket in the back cover. The last 16 pages are detachable.\n\nThese journals are lettered by hand, which make them unique and one of a kind. They make the perfect gift for a birthday, graduation, anniversary, and more. If you would like your journal giftwrapped, please choose the option from the dropdown list. Please allow 1-2 weeks for production and shipping.

Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band)","description":"Beatles Spiral Notebook \/ Journal Vinyl Record Album Cover Art\n\nFun, unique, handmade, spiral, coil bound Notebook \/ Journal is made from the original vinyl record album cover!\n\n&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released in June 1967.\n\n&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was a worldwide success, spending 27 weeks at #1 on the UK Album Chart and 15 weeks at #1 on the US Billboard 200. It also won four Grammy Awards in 1968. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is considered by many to be the most influential and famous rock album ever, and has been named the greatest album of all time by both All Time Top 1000 Albums and Rolling Stone.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning album packaging was art-directed by Robert Fraser, designed by Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, his wife and artistic partner, and photographed by Michael Cooper. It featured a colourful collage of life-sized cardboard models of famous people on the front of the album cover and the lyrics printed in full on the back cover, the first time this had been done on a rock LP.  In the guise of the Sgt. Pepper band, the Beatles were dressed in custom-made military-style outfits made of satin dyed in day-glo colours. The suits were designed by Manuel Cuevas. Among the insignia on their uniforms are: MBE medals on McCartney&#39;s and Harrison&#39;s jackets, the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom on Lennon&#39;s right sleeve and an Ontario Provincial Police flash on McCartney&#39;s sleeve.\n\nThis notebook  measures 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d and contains 75 to 80 blank white recycled acid-free paper pages.  Can be ordered with lined paper, just let me know.\nBound with a flexible coil binding.\n\nThis notebook includes both sides of the gatefold album artwork.\nExcellent for use as a sketch book, journaling, doodling or as a  notebook.\n\nRecord Covers are wiped cleaned with an all natural essentials oils product before being upcycled, which also works as a disinfectant without the use of chemicals.\n\nThis album cover is in good shape for it\u2019s age! \nThere is some slight wear noticeable.\n\nPictured is the exact item you will receive.\n\nNotebooks are priced on the rarity of the artist\/group and condition of the album cover.\n\nA unique, fun, recycled, upcycled item for your pleasure or gift giving!\n\nNeither the album nor cover was in collectible shape and was being discarded. Therefore scuffs and wear are to be expected and add to its vintage appeal and authenticity. I do my best to preserve the most desirable parts of the cover art.\n\nI do combine shipping on multiple ordered being shipped to the same address. Contact me if you have any questions.\n\nCheck out all my other vinyl record bowls and trays, vinyl jewelry, vinyl business card holders \/ iPhone stand, other record album journals, and other recycled art!\n\nBack to my shop: http:\/\/colerainecreations.etsy.com","creation_tsz":1432317728,"ending_tsz":1442944928,"original_creation_tsz":1432228543,"last_modified_tsz":1432317729,"price":"15.95","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["music","rock","upcycled","sketch","book","bound","journal","notebook","record album","ecofriendly","colorful","recycled","Fathers Day"],"category_path":["Books and Zines","Journal"],"category_path_ids":[69150385,68887510],"materials":["original vinyl record album cover","blank white paper","flexible coil binding"],"shop_section_id":7194543,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1432228543,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/234220169\/beatles-spiral-notebook-journal-vinyl?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":3,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":4781677,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Retro"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":326,"taxonomy_path":["Books, Movies & Music","Books","Blank Books","Journals & Notebooks"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":775549117,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1432228543,"listing_id":234220169,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/5485730\/il_75x75.775549117_gg0n.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/5485730\/il_170x135.775549117_gg0n.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/5485730\/il_570xN.775549117_gg0n.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/5485730\/il_fullxfull.775549117_gg0n.jpg","full_height":960,"full_width":1014},{"listing_image_id":775549167,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1432228543,"listing_id":234220169,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/5485730\/il_75x75.775549167_mows.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/5485730\/il_170x135.775549167_mows.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/5485730\/il_570xN.775549167_mows.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/5485730\/il_fullxfull.775549167_mows.jpg","full_height":960,"full_width":973},{"listing_image_id":775509784,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1432228543,"listing_id":234220169,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/065\/0\/5485730\/il_75x75.775509784_dkwt.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/065\/0\/5485730\/il_170x135.775509784_dkwt.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/065\/0\/5485730\/il_570xN.775509784_dkwt.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/065\/0\/5485730\/il_fullxfull.775509784_dkwt.jpg","full_height":961,"full_width":1001},{"listing_image_id":775549251,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1432228543,"listing_id":234220169,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/062\/0\/5485730\/il_75x75.775549251_8yf9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/062\/0\/5485730\/il_170x135.775549251_8yf9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/062\/0\/5485730\/il_570xN.775549251_8yf9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/062\/0\/5485730\/il_fullxfull.775549251_8yf9.jpg","full_height":960,"full_width":1038}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5485730,"shop_name":"colerainecreations","user_id":6999011,"creation_tsz":1235867129,"title":"Vinyl Record Album Bowls Upcycled Recycled Art Vintage","announcement":"Welcome to my shop!!\r\n\r\nDue to the limited supply of albums available for recycling, do not wait to purchase one of these unique pieces of functional music history.

It is specially made to carry your iphone (or other smartphone) and two pens or pencils.  \r\n\r\nI specifically made this for my girlfriend who was constantly complaining about dropping her phone each time she was trying to rush to a meeting while carrying her laptop, notebook, iPhone and pen.  Now all those smaller objects are securely held on her notebook and can be accessed whenever needed. \r\n\r\nThis handy notebook belt doesn&#39;t close your notebook shut, but simply allows you to organize the stuff right on the front or back cover. That means you can grab a pen, open the notebook and get to writing. \r\n\r\nThe front portion of the belt is made out of a high quality PVC fabric, with a black elastic strap across the middle.  The elastic is sown to hold an iPhone with cover and two pens or pencils, which when placed are held tightly in place. \r\n\r\nThe back portion of the belt is also elastic so that you can secure it onto any hardcover A4 notebook, and never have to worry about it falling off.  Once you&#39;ve filled out your notebook or journal, simply slide off the belt and place it on your new one. \r\n\r\nThe fabric is faux green ostrich skin, or pleather, meaning it&#39;s 100% vegan friendly\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\nWidth: 3.9&quot;  (10cm)\r\nHeight: 12&quot; (30cm) - this is the height when it&#39;s on an A4 notebook, however, the elastic back allows it to fit on larger or smaller covers. \r\n\r\nCellphone holder:\r\nMade for iPhone 4\/4S with cover, but can be adjusted as needed per smartphone\r\n\r\nI&#39;m happy to make adjustments for A5 notebooks or journals and for any smartphone, just contact me via Etsy.\r\n\r\nOrion (belt) come in Diffrent colors...\r\n\r\nBlue vinyl\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/98381477\/patenta4-notebook-beltiphone-carrier\r\n\r\nGucci

Intentional Home Daily journal - A Bible based notebook field guide for busy women, mama&#39;s & young girls","description":"MOVING SALE!!!!  REGULAR PRICE IS 1 Journal for $29!  Moving Sale... GET 2 FOR $40! While supplies last!\n\nI am SO excited to introduce to you a little piece of my heart.  The Intentional Home Daily journal.  My little &quot;Field Guide for Home&quot;.  This 10 week, combination journal\/planner\/guide is meant to help women of all age ranges, professions and home lives bring more purpose, focus, and Jesus into their days.\n\nWE JUST RECEIVED AN UPDATE FROM PRODUCTION & WE WILL HAVE THIS ITEM IN HAND TO SHIP THE WEEK OF JANUARY THE 26TH- 30TH 2015!\n\n\n\nThe Story:\n\nFor ten years I have ran multiple businesses out of my home while juggling other responsibilities like wifey, mommy, driver, chef, maid.. you get the picture.  I struggled deeply with staying on task and actually getting things done.  So often I would reach the end of the day, look around at the piles of laundry and mayhem on my desk and wonder.. what exactly DID I accomplish today?  And fitting in a quiet time? Forget about it.  \n\nI knew I needed to find something that would help me stay on task.  And not only for practical purposes, but for my spiritual health as well.   I searched endlessly trying to find something that would work for the way my brain ticks.  And nothing.  I have dear friends that design gorgeous planners that I love looking at, but they don&#39;t fit my lifestyle.  I didn&#39;t need something that scheduled.  My personality just can&#39;t wrap my mind around timelines and appointments.  Yes.. I laugh at myself about that. But it&#39;s true.\n\nWhat I needed was something....  One thing that could do the job of many. I needed a planner, a journal, something to keep me washed in the word, something to help me focus on what mattered and what needed prayer.   I needed a rough &quot;guide&quot; for my days.  And I needed it to be compact enough to fit in my purse.  I spend 98% of my days at home balancing all of my roles.  I don&#39;t have a lot of appointments other than dance class and football practice, this &quot;planner&quot; I was looking for needed to reflect a looser system.  Last spring I started to design what my perfect day would look like.  I wanted to read the Bible every day... focus my heart on gratitude.  Focus on a few completable tasks each day, and remember to slow down enough to cultivate the moments I wanted my children to remember. At first I just used scratch paper, or napkins but soon, I had it all mapped out and hired a designer to make it even prettier.  I started printing out these papers every day and using them to keep me on track.  And you know what??? It DID!!!!  I found myself getting more accomplished and feeling more at peace and less overwhelmed.  Eventually they began cluttering my desk and I needed to get rid of them, but I was so sad about it.  I mean, I had poured my heart out on these pages.  They held my accomplishments, my fears, my thoughts and dreams.  I couldn&#39;t just trash them!   That&#39;s when it dawned on me how incredible it would be if I had a collection of these sheets that I could keep for generations and reflect back on. And a pretty little purse sized journal seemed like the perfect fit.\n\nSo here we are, a few hundred hours and several months later, and I&#39;m THRILLED to show this little lady off to all of you!  I am seriously smitten.  And I hope and pray that this little piece of my heart is a blessing to many women, girls, mama&#39;s, grandma&#39;s and business ladies who are trying to be more purposeful with their days.  \n \n\nThe Details:  \n\nThis gorgeous spiral bound hardcover journal is as pretty as it is useful.  The 5x8 size makes it perfect for using at your desk, carrying in your purse or writing in while you watch kids at practice.  At least it does for me!  The spiral binding allows you to fold it completely in half for easy writing when away from your desk.  There is a page at the beginning to write your name in case someone finds it, or if there are more than one of you in your home that use it.  Like my daughter and I.   \n\nThe setup of this journal is the first one of it&#39;s kind and is filled with a combination of goal sheets, to do lists, prompted thoughts, daily Bible verses, prayer needs, praise reports, free journaling space and ways to love on others.   It is broken down into weeks and then days.  At the beginning of each week you will find a section to refocus your heart and jot down what is important to you for the week ahead &quot;memories I want to make&quot; and &quot;anything & everything&quot;.  Next you will find your &quot;Intentional Day&quot; pages.  Each day of the week has 4 pages.  The first one begins with a Bible verse for the day followed by guided prompts to help bring focus, purpose and fulfillment to your days.  Pages 2-4 are free journalling space.   They could be used for additional comments from the previous page, an added to do list, writing out your prayers or thoughts or really anything your little heart desires.  There are seven of these 4-page days and then it starts over.  All of the pages are undated because we want you to get the most use out of the journal as possible.  If you use it every day, GREAT!  If you use it every few days, AWESOME!  We don&#39;t want you to have wasted blank pages so we left the dates to you!  This journal covers 10 weeks ( 70 days ) \n\n\n\n\nPS... this IS a great gift for young ladies.  My daughter is 9 and she absolutely LOVES hers!","creation_tsz":1432317378,"ending_tsz":1442944578,"original_creation_tsz":1413335958,"last_modified_tsz":1432317378,"price":"40.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":89,"tags":["journal","prayer journal","christian journal","planner","daily bible","inspiration","notebook","teen girl journal","bible study","devotional","christian gift","gift for mom","homeschool"],"category_path":["Books and Zines","Journal"],"category_path_ids":[69150385,68887510],"materials":["spiral bound","hard cover","paper"],"shop_section_id":15498739,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1427305368,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/207198299\/sale-2-for-40-intentional-home-daily?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":7040,"num_favorers":259,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"women","occasion":"christmas","style":["Cottage Chic","Minimalist"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":326,"taxonomy_path":["Books, Movies & Music","Books","Blank Books","Journals & Notebooks"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":667342066,"hex_code":"B7ADA4","red":183,"green":173,"blue":164,"hue":28,"saturation":10,"brightness":71,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1413335958,"listing_id":207198299,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_75x75.667342066_fqbn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_170x135.667342066_fqbn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_570xN.667342066_fqbn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_fullxfull.667342066_fqbn.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":667471659,"hex_code":"B6ABA2","red":182,"green":171,"blue":162,"hue":27,"saturation":10,"brightness":71,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1413335958,"listing_id":207198299,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/9519443\/il_75x75.667471659_8vad.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/9519443\/il_170x135.667471659_8vad.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/9519443\/il_570xN.667471659_8vad.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/9519443\/il_fullxfull.667471659_8vad.jpg","full_height":1156,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":667472165,"hex_code":"968D8A","red":150,"green":141,"blue":138,"hue":15,"saturation":8,"brightness":58,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1413335958,"listing_id":207198299,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9519443\/il_75x75.667472165_7gea.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9519443\/il_170x135.667472165_7gea.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9519443\/il_570xN.667472165_7gea.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9519443\/il_fullxfull.667472165_7gea.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":667342480,"hex_code":"AAA8A8","red":170,"green":168,"blue":168,"hue":0,"saturation":1,"brightness":66,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1413335958,"listing_id":207198299,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9519443\/il_75x75.667342480_mep9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9519443\/il_170x135.667342480_mep9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9519443\/il_570xN.667342480_mep9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9519443\/il_fullxfull.667342480_mep9.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":667342466,"hex_code":"C9C5C7","red":201,"green":197,"blue":199,"hue":330,"saturation":1,"brightness":78,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1413335958,"listing_id":207198299,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_75x75.667342466_to1i.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_170x135.667342466_to1i.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_570xN.667342466_to1i.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/9519443\/il_fullxfull.667342466_to1i.jpg","full_height":1431,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9519443,"shop_name":"IntentionalHome","user_id":48374666,"creation_tsz":1400447162,"title":"Bringing Truth & Purpose into homes via pretty papers!","announcement":"WELCOME!

We want to fill homes with scripture to encourage us in the every day, and help busy mamas, wives and students bring more focus and purpose to their days.   \r\n\r\nWhen we started the adoption process we knew that God would have to cover the gap for all of the expenses.  But we also knew that we had a part in it too.  We thought of countless ways we could raise money to bring or sweet child home, but nothing lit a fire in our hearts more than helping others.  So we pulled together our love for design, community, intentional living, pretty paper and great photography and the Intentional Home Shop was born.  We strive to bring you the highest quality of unique and beautiful handmade goods to bring joy, purpose and encouragement to your home.  We hope you love the things as much as we do!  All profits from any purchase in our shop goes into our adoption fund.  The Adoption Fundraiser section is filled with donated items from other artists who wanted to help bring our little one home, but the items in the rest of the shop also go to support the Adoption.  \r\n\r\nWe ship orders out on Tuesdays.
